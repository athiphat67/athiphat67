## ðŸš€ MyProject
### Kibo-RPC 6th (NSTDA-à¸ªà¸§à¸—à¸Š.) 2025


As the **Team Leader**, I led this Kibo-RPC project, which was developed entirely in Java via Android Studio. The project's main objective was to optimize the control and navigation of the Astrobee robot.


The project team received **the Outstanding Presentation Award** at the national championship, where the team finished **6th**.

**Key features of this project include:**

- Optimized control and navigation for the Astrobee robot.

- Utilization of OpenCV for advanced image processing.

- Integration of a custom-trained YOLOv8n model (converted to TFLite) for object detection.

- Implementation of precise vector translation for accurate reporting within the simulation.

You can find all project details in the repository link below.
