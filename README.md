## ðŸš€ MyProject
### Kibo-RPC (NSTDA-à¸ªà¸§à¸—à¸Š.)


The project team received **the Outstanding Presentation Award** at the national championship, where the team finished **6th**.


My Kibo-RPC project, developed entirely in Java via Android Studio, optimized Astrobee control and navigation, utilized OpenCV for image processing, integrated a custom-trained YOLOv8n model (converted to TFLite) for object detection, and implemented precise vector translation for reporting within the simulation. You can see all details in repo link.
