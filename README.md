**Theme:** Space Treasure Hunt with NASA's Astrobee Robot 🤖🛰️

As the **Team Leader**, I managed the project timeline and led the development of autonomous navigation and vision systems using **Java (Android)**. Our team, **"SENSUAY"**, achieved **6th Place** and won the **Best Presentation Award** for outstanding technical communication.

### 💡 Key Technical Implementations:
- **Advanced Computer Vision (OpenCV):** Engineered a pipeline for **Lens Undistortion**, **ArUco Marker Tracking**, and **Perspective Warping** (Homography) to transform angled camera feeds into precise bird's-eye views.
- **Machine Learning Pipeline:** Curated a custom dataset of 2,500 images and trained a **YOLOv8n** model, successfully converting and deploying it as **TensorFlow Lite (.tflite)** for on-device inference.
- **Precise Control:** Implemented **Quaternion-based** kinematics and vector translation to ensure accurate robot movement in a microgravity simulation.
